# Goal

To produce a simple program with which two users can play chess against one another.

Setup

1. Clone Repo
2. Create a lib directory at root, and install the necessary jars
    2a - junit 4.13 - <https://search.maven.org/artifact/junit/junit/4.13/jar>
    2b - hamcrest 1.3 - <http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/h/Downloadhamcrestall13jar.htm>
    2c - log4j 1.2.17 - <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/logging/log4j/1.2.17/log4j-1.2.17.tar.gz>
3. Ensure your machine has java and ant installed
4. Run 'ant main'. This will produce the local build directory and run the program
